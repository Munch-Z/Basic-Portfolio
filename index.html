<p>Hello! I am currently a Team Lead for a technology and consulting firm in Bellevue, WA. I'm passionate about learning and furthering my career, so I've recently enrolled in Univeristy of Washington's Coding Bootcamp. I hope to use the skills that I acquire through this, and my current work experience, to make a career in web development. I'm very passionate about improving myself, and always looking for ways to uplevel myself and those around me. I find solving problems exhilerating, and hope to bring my passion and drive to new and exciting opportunites.</p>
