<p id="bio-paragraph"> Hello! I am currently a Team Lead for a technology and consulting firm in Bellevue WA. I'm passionate about learning and furthering my career, so I've recently enrolled in Univeristy of Washington's Coding Bootcamp. I hope to use the skills that I acquire through this Bootcamp, and my current work experience, to make a career in development and project management.

In my free time, I enjoy reading (currently the leader of a book club), playing games, and hanging out with friends. I'm very passionate about improving myself, and always looking for ways to improve and/or learn. I find solving problems exhilerating, and hope to bring my passion and drive to your team!</p>
